      <h2>Site Review</h2>
      <h3 id="site-name">Trader Joe's — <span class="url"><span class="mono">https://www.traderjoes.com</span></span></h3>

      <p><span class="q">1) First impression:</span></p>
      <p class="answer">The site felt simple, but put together well.</p>

      <p><span class="q">2) Information flow:</span></p>
      <p class="answer">Most of the flow is from the drop down in the top left, and the front page is almost blog-style esque.</p>

      <p><span class="q">3) Structure makes sense?</span></p>
      <p class="answer">I don't love it because you have to click on things. I would like pop-ups as I hover over them. Also, I don't love the intro page; I want to see something visual on the front page that directs me in the right direction.</p>

      <p><span class="q">4) Graphics/layout/multimedia:</span></p>
      <p class="answer">The background and the background of the shapes on top are the same, making it feel clunky. Black on black or white on white isn't great to me — they should be different shades so the front image stands out.</p>

      <p><span class="q">5) Load time:</span></p>
      <p class="answer">It loaded near instantly. Totally happy with it.</p>

      <p><span class="q">6) Readability & background:</span></p>
      <p class="answer">Most sites are actually smaller or larger than I like to see, but Trader Joe's was pleasantly in the middle.</p>

      <p><span class="q">7) Navigation quality:</span></p>
      <p class="answer">I never use search bars unless I can't find something because they're usually terrible. In this case I felt like it wasn't super useful, as I kept getting blog-post type results instead of products.</p>

      <p><span class="q">8) Consistent look & feel:</span></p>
      <p class="answer">The scheme felt warm and inviting, like a grandma's kitchen. I suspect Trader Joe's wanted that on purpose.</p>

      <p><span class="q">9) Responsive behavior:</span></p>
      <p class="answer">Surprisingly well done. I didn't have to use the horizontal scroll bar; it resized well until extremely small window sizes.</p>

      <p><span class="q">10) Notable strengths:</span></p>
      <p class="answer">I see a lot of sites with popups, but these popups were all colored differently, which almost didn't fit the vibe of the site. I especially found it frustrating finding the X's to shut the popups off.</p>
