        <h2>David and Mary Farnsworth</h2>
        <p>David always dreamed of heliskiing, and their honeymoon was the perfect opportunity. With expert pilots and guides, they made six powder-filled runs a day on Kings Peak, Utah's tallest mountain. Their gear was inspected by their guide to ensure safety, and the couple praised the attention to detail that allowed them to focus on enjoying the adventure together.</p>
